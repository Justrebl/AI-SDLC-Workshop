# Maintainer handbook

This handbook gives a new maintainer enough context to pick up the workshop without the original authoring notes. It records why the workshop is shaped the way it is, what was verified and how, what is still open, and how to continue the work.

For writing rules, upstream pins and validation commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). For timing and the facilitator's messaging guardrails, see [tutor.md](tutor.md).

## When to use this handbook

- You are taking over maintenance or preparing a new delivery.
- You want to change the scope, order or tooling of a workshop and need to know which decisions it would reopen.
- You are about to re-verify the workshop against new releases of Copilot, Copilot CLI, APM, HVE-Core or GitHub agentic workflows.

## Workshop intent

The workshop runs over two 4-hour workshop sessions for a technical audience. Each workshop builds on the previous one, so the progression is the main design constraint.

| Workshop | Focus | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero | Copilot primitives: completions, chat, instructions, prompts, agents, skills, MCP, hooks | Wraps [Philess/GHCopilotHoL](https://github.com/Philess/GHCopilotHoL) and adds Levels 7 to 9 plus an advanced Deeper primitives page |
| 2. The SDLC Workshop | HVE principles, Design Thinking, RPI, APM and plugin marketplace, agentic workflows, Copilot cloud agent delegation | Original content in this repository |

The [README crescendo](../README.md#the-crescendo) explains the order to attendees. Read it before you reorder modules.

## Design decisions

These decisions shape the content. Changing one usually affects several modules, the solutions and the workshop tester. The problem, scope, stakeholders and assumptions behind them are in the [design documentation](design/README.md).

| # | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Two 4-hour workshop sessions | Fits a customer's half-day slots and separates individual use (GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero) from team and SDLC use (the SDLC Workshop). |
| D2 | GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero follows GHCopilotHoL | Reuses a maintained lab instead of forking it. Upstream commits are pinned in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#upstream-pins). |
| D3 | The SDLC Workshop runs in three acts: build the feature (HVE principles → Design Thinking → RPI), scale the method (APM, policy and plugin marketplace → agentic workflows), then close the loop (delegation to Copilot cloud agent and review) | Each step reuses the output of the previous one. The README crescendo and the "Why this level" lines say what each level adds and why the previous one was not enough. |
| D4 | Hands-on first, demos as fallback | Attendees keep working assets. The tutor guide lists the demo fallbacks. |
| D5 | Environment setup happens before the day | Setup failures should not consume workshop time. See [prerequisites.md](prerequisites.md) and the `before-d-day-*.md` checklists. |
| D6 | One application for all of the SDLC Workshop: the Music Catalog (`src/front` React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, `src/api` .NET 10 minimal API) | One shared context keeps prompts, reviews and workflows comparable across the room. |
| D7 | Attendees start from a hello-world starter | Keeps the slice small enough to finish. |
| D8 | One feature: browse tracks and add a track to a playlist | Small enough for a learning loop, rich enough to exercise evidence, a design decision, and acceptance review. |
| D9 | Exactly one in-memory playlist: no persistence, no users, no playlist creation or reordering | Avoids databases and authentication, which add setup without teaching the method. |
| D10 | Duplicate-feedback UX remains a real decision. The planner explores approaches; the duplicate-rejection contract and empty-state text stay fixed | Attendees judge trade-offs at the plan gate and debrief contrasting choices. Do not preselect the agent's alternatives or require identical implementation details. |
| D11 | Use HVE's native instructions, skills, and handoffs with short, source-linked requests. DT is a learner-led sampler; BRD/PRD derive from reviewed inputs; RPI consumes the preceding artifacts | Supply facts, scope, and decisions rather than outlines or coding recipes. Save the delivery brief before PRD Builder. The tester replays curated contributions without treating them as human research or approval. |
| D12 | Design Thinking plus RPI takes under 2 hours, including the context engineering segment and the decision debrief | Leaves time for APM, workflows, delegation and the architect capstone. |
| D13 | HVE-Core is installed through APM inside the application repository | Copilot cloud agent and agentic workflows only see what is in the repository, so a local plugin is not enough. |
| D14–D15 | Agentic workflows: daily backlog management, accessibility review, and security-review delegation | Shows recurring automation that feeds issues back to people and agents. |
| D16 | Level 5 reconciles opted-in issues with committed planning and linked delivery evidence, then delegates a bounded RPI issue to Copilot cloud agent. Level 6 explicitly requests Copilot review and verifies issue/Project progress | See the [Level 4-6 learning-flow decisions](project-planning/levels-4-6-learning-flow.md). No invented findings, automatic assignment, or closure from merge alone. |
| D18 | Verification as contract: required `test` and `apm-audit` checks are added before delegation, and `copilot-setup-steps.yml` is extended with a build step | Level 4 copies the audit-only `apm-audit.yml`; Level 5 enables its no-bypass ruleset after setup pushes. The agent's pull request is judged by the same checks as a human's. Solutions: `solutions/afternoon-2/.github/workflows/{ci,apm-audit}.yml` and `solutions/afternoon-2/rulesets/{main-tests-required,main-apm-audit-required}.json`. |
| D19 | GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero fast track for advanced audiences: upstream Levels 1 to 4 become pre-work or a demo, and the time goes to the Deeper primitives page (instruction layering, a guardrail hook, MCP governance) | Advanced developers and architects need layering and limits, not another pass on completions. Timing is in [tutor.md](tutor.md). |
| D20 | The SDLC Workshop ends with an architect capstone: org rollout, measuring impact, brownfield adoption, choosing a method, and a model decision guide | Architects leave with the decisions they must take to scale the method. Model and usage guidance lives here, without prices. |
| D21 | Progressive disclosure: short level introductions, optional deeper explanations, and a visible hands-on path | The [Workshop Authoring skill](../.github/skills/workshop-authoring/SKILL.md) owns the rule and Workshop Creator loads it before content work. Required prompts, prerequisites, warnings, success criteria, and human gates are not hidden. |
| D17 | Reference for agentic workflow layout: [CoffeesoftDotDev/accessibility-copilot](https://github.com/CoffeesoftDotDev/accessibility-copilot) | A working `.md` plus compiled `.lock.yml` example. It also showed that workflows can open repeated failure issues, so the solutions limit and deduplicate their outputs. |

Later additions follow the same pattern:

- **Role tracks.** These are the product manager, developer (RPI) and security tracks, based on the [HVE-Core role guides](https://microsoft.github.io/hve-core/docs/hve-guide/roles/tpm).
- **Levels 4-6.** APM is the participant installation exercise; private marketplace and accessibility examples are separate proctor demos. Level 6 independently reviews the cloud agent's RPI PR. The old marketplace test-writer exercise is no longer on the core path.
- **Threat model sidebars.** Levels 5 and 6 each list the agentic risks (prompt injection, safe outputs, firewall, token scope) and the control that answers each one.
- **RPI Agent.** A section explains that RPI Agent runs the `/rpi-*` phases.
- **Workshop Creator agent.** Defined in `.github/agents/workshop-creator.agent.md`, it reproduces this repository's creation path for a new workshop.

## Scope limits

Keep these out of the attendee path unless the design decisions above change:

- No database, file writes or external services in the Music Catalog. State stays in memory.
- No additional front-end state-management or UI libraries.
- Cost and Auto model selection appear only as a short decision guide in the architect capstone. HydraFusion stays in Extra Credits as a Research Preview. No prices or quotas appear anywhere.
- No real customer or personal data. Use synthetic data only.

## Verified facts and how they were checked

Re-check these whenever you bump a version. The dates and versions are from the original verification.

| Fact | How it was checked |
| --- | --- |
| `apm install microsoft/hve-core --target copilot` works; without `--target`, an empty repository fails with "No harness detected" | Run live with APM 0.32.0 on Windows |
| HVE-Core cannot be pinned by release tag (`#hve-core-v3.2.2` fails with "no apm.yml found"); pinning by commit SHA works | Run live. The pin is the v3.2.2 commit `1dbd6a7`, recorded in `solutions/afternoon-2/apm.yml` |
| `apm audit --ci` fails without `apm.lock.yaml`; it passes with the lockfile and the sample policy | Run live. Upstream labels `--policy` experimental, but policy auditing requires no experimental-feature activation |
| RPI commands `/rpi`, `/rpi-research`, `/rpi-plan`, `/rpi-implement` and `/rpi-review` exist. The phase commands are skills that also run without RPI Agent. RPI Agent asks for a working mode only when the request does not set one | Read against the installed HVE-Core 3.2.2 plugin files |
| Agentic workflows use `engine: copilot`, safe outputs, and compiled `.lock.yml` files generated by `gh aw compile`, never written by hand | Read in the [gh-aw documentation](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/) |

When a fact cannot be confirmed in official documentation, label it as preview, experimental or unverified in the guide rather than presenting it as settled.

## Open assumptions and risks

| Item | Status | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer licences cover Copilot CLI, Copilot cloud agent and agentic workflows | Unverified per customer. Check on the [kick-off call](kick-off-call-checklist.md) | High |
| The customer organization allows plugin marketplaces, APM sources and the required network hosts | Unverified per customer. See [prerequisites.md](prerequisites.md) | High |
| Design Thinking plus RPI fits in 2 hours with native HVE guidance and short task requests | Not yet measured in a dry run | High |
| Attendees can create the branch ruleset with `gh api` | Needs the admin role on the repository, and a plan that supports rulesets on private repositories. The bypass actor uses the repository admin role (`actor_id` 5); not tested live | Medium |
| The delegated pull request is ready by Level 6 | Depends on the agent run time; not measured in a dry run | Medium |
| Shared acceptance criteria give comparable outcomes despite different agent questions and design choices | Assumed; live delivery not measured | Medium |
| The three solution workflows (`daily-backlog.md`, `a11y-review.md`, `security-review-delegation.md`) compile and run in a real repository | Not compiled in this repository. Run `gh aw compile` in a test repository before delivery | Medium |
| Private marketplace and accessibility demos are available to attendees | Attendee access is not required; proctor uses the supplied captures and prepared output | Low |

## Current status

### Pedagogy review after the tester

The repository custom agent [Workshop Pedagogy Reviewer](../.github/agents/workshop-pedagogy-reviewer.agent.md) critiques content, narrative flow, presentation, and the short concept primer at the beginning of each level. It reads the target repository's existing issues and linked PR evidence to distinguish tracked, partially addressed, new, and uncertain findings. It does not execute the lab, change files, or mutate the backlog itself. It complements the execution tester; neither a green test run nor an editorial assessment proves learner comprehension.

The [pedagogy review workflow](../.github/workflows/workshop-pedagogy-review.yml) runs after **Workshop tester: Afternoon 2 validation report** completes on `main`, including successful runs that create no failure issue. It uses the tester's exact commit and reports the tester conclusion as context. Failed or cancelled tester runs do not prevent a content review, but they do not establish successful execution. Same-repository and tester-path checks exclude fork and unrelated workflow runs.

Setup:

1. Keep the existing `WORKSHOP_TESTER_ENABLED=true` opt-in; attendee copies remain inactive.
2. Create the repository label **`pedagogy-review`** in GitHub's Issues > Labels before the first run. The publisher does not create or edit labels.
3. Allow the job's repository-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` to make Copilot requests through the organization's policy, or set an optional **`WORKSHOP_PEDAGOGY_TOKEN`** fine-grained PAT with **Copilot Requests** plus **Contents, Issues, and Pull requests read access** to this repository only. The built-in GitHub MCP server uses the CLI's signed-in credential, so an inference-only token cannot supply the required repository reads. Do not reuse or broaden the tester's infrastructure/sandbox token; the reviewer receives no issue-write credential. No secret is created automatically.
4. Ensure Copilot CLI Auto routing is allowed. The workflow pins CLI `1.0.90-3` and explicitly requests `--model auto --auto-tier intelligence`; a fixed model is not substituted if this fails. Review the pin periodically.

The workflow copies Markdown documents into an isolated review workspace and records local image existence without giving the model image pixels. It loads the custom agent from the trusted automation checkout and treats the reviewed revision as data: it never executes that revision's scripts or lab commands. Shell and file writes remain denied, project instructions and GitHub IQ are disabled, and the GitHub MCP server exposes an explicit read-only tool list. The agent profile allowlist covers file reads/search plus those GitHub reads; it contains no write, assignment, or delegation tools. All issue searches are constrained to the supplied repository, and remote document evidence uses the reviewed SHA. Live issue/PR states may be newer than that document snapshot and must be identified as such. Missing GitHub authorization is reported as incomplete backlog evidence, not a successful inspection.

The CLI's stdout is validated for report sections and coverage rows. A separate job with `issues: write` creates or refreshes one `pedagogy-review` report per tester run attempt. Refresh requires the exact provenance marker, report-title prefix, label, and `github-actions[bot]` authorship. It replaces only the marked generated section, preserving maintainer additions and issue state. Identical reruns make no update. For old reports without a generated section, changed output is added once as a digest-marked comment instead of overwriting the body. Malformed markers fail publication explicitly. The publisher never assigns, closes, reopens, or edits unrelated backlog issues or labels.

If inference or report validation fails, the run is marked failed and the summary states that the review is incomplete; no report issue is created. If publishing fails, the validated report remains in the summary and the `workshop-pedagogy-report` artifact. Fix the missing label or permission and rerun the failed job.

To review manually, run `gh workflow run workshop-pedagogy-review.yml --ref main`. To invoke the same read-only agent locally, run `copilot --agent workshop-pedagogy-reviewer --model auto --auto-tier intelligence`, explicitly name the GitHub repository, and request a review of both local guides plus the current issue context. Your login must have repository read access. Local use returns a report in the conversation; only the Actions publisher maintains report issues. Broader issue changes remain a separate reviewed backlog-execution workflow.

Run the local regression checks with `node --test tests/workshop/pedagogy/review.test.mjs`. Live inference, publication permissions, and learner comprehension still need a maintainer dry run after these files reach `main`.

- **Guides.** Both guides keep `published: false` until a dry run is complete.
- **Kick-off deck.** `docs/kick-off.pptx` is current on `main`.
- **Open work.** [#26](https://github.com/Justrebl/AI-SDLC-Workshop/pull/26) adds Codespace security guardrails to the workshop tester.
  - Its source changes are complete and checked statically.
  - The live runs need a `WORKSHOP_TESTER_SANDBOX_TOKEN` repository secret: a fine-grained token with Contents, Issues, Pull requests, Actions and Workflows read and write, and Metadata read.
  - Run once with the egress lock off and once with `WORKSHOP_TESTER_EGRESS_LOCK=1`.
- **Organization settings.** An organization admin still needs to apply the Codespaces and Copilot budget settings described in [#26](https://github.com/Justrebl/AI-SDLC-Workshop/pull/26) before the tester runs unattended.

## Resume the work

### Prerequisites

- Copilot CLI or VS Code with the [HVE-Core plugin](https://microsoft.github.io/hve-core/) installed.
- `gh` with the `gh aw` extension, and `apm`.
- .NET 10 SDK and Node.js for the starter application.

### Step 1: Start from `main` on a feature branch

Use one branch and one pull request per feature. Run `git switch -c feature/<topic> origin/main`.

### Step 2: Run the change through RPI

Type `/rpi`, select the HVE-Core prompt, and press **Tab**. Add the task before sending the whole message, or run the phases yourself. For example:

```text
/hve-core:rpi.prompt

Re-verify Level 4 against the latest APM release and update the guide and solutions.
```

During Research, give the agent this handbook, the [design documentation](design/README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [tutor.md](tutor.md#messaging-guardrails) so it inherits the decisions, writing rules and guardrails. Expect the agent to verify commands against official documentation before it changes a guide.

### Step 3: Validate and open the pull request

Run the checks in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#validation) that apply to your change, then open a pull request with a conventional commit prefix. Preview the guide on MOAW from your branch.

### Step 4: Merge stacked pull requests

If several pull requests are stacked on each other, merge them with the asynchronous merge API on the top pull request. This merges every open pull request below it:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/Justrebl/AI-SDLC-Workshop/pulls/<top-pr>/merge-async -f merge_method=merge
```

`gh pr merge` returns an error for pull requests that are part of a stack.

## Expected outcome

The change is on `main`, the attendee guides stay free of maintainer-only content, and the [workshop tester](../tests/workshop/afternoon-2/README.md) replays the SDLC Workshop without opening a failure issue.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `gh aw compile` hangs | Add `--no-check-update` |
| `apm install` fails with "No harness detected" | Pass `--target copilot` |
| APM rejects the HVE-Core pin | Pin a commit SHA, not a release tag |
| Starter readiness reports a dirty working tree | Use a fresh template copy or the documented copy fallback; prerequisite checks do not create an extra baseline commit |
